# The World of Lutemons
A program that mimics the world of Pok√©mons developed as a part of the course CT60A2411 Object oriented Programming of LUT University, Finland.<br>
The program enables users to create Lutemons, which are then stored home. User has then an option to move those Lutemons to a training area or to a battle field.
When a Lutemon is trained it gains experience, which affects other features. If experience is 2 then in fighting attack will get that +2 points.<br>
Battle is turn based where one Lutemon attacks to another, which then uses its defenses and then attacks back. When one of them has health 0 or less the other one wins and gains an experience point. 
The other one dies and gets removed from the program. The winner gains one point of experience.<br>
Once Lutemon is moved back to home it gains full health.<br>
